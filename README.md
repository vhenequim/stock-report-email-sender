This is a script that gathers data from pre-defined stocks, gathers news from them and send it to a pre-defined email on a daily basis (exceptions when the stock exchange doesn't open)
The code is commented, but if you have any doubts, criticism or suggestion please contact me.
It is a simple project, but with a broad range of functionalities
